# Multi-Channel Time-Encoding

This repository contains code to sample and reconstruct bandlimited signals using time encoding machines that use a perfect integrate-and-fire paradigm.

# Basic usage
Create a python environment using your favorite way, and install the packages listed in requirements.txt, for example using:
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
The tests can be run by calling
'''
pytest
'''
and include some working examples.
More working examples can be found in the paper-specific repositories listed below.
