# Multi-Channel Time-Encoding

This repository contains code to sample and reconstruct bandlimited signals using time encoding machines that use a perfect integrate-and-fire paradigm.

# Basic usage
Create a python environment using your favorite way, and install the packages listed in requirements.txt, for example using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The tests can be run by calling
```
pytest
```
and include some working examples.
More working examples can be found in the paper-specific repositories listed below.
